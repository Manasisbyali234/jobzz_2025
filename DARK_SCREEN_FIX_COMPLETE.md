# Dark Screen Issue - Complete Fix

## Problem
Dark screen appearing when:
1. Clicking main menu button on candidate dashboard

- Fixed modal positioning without backdrops
- Improved sidebar overlay behavior
- Added comprehensive browser compatibility

### 2. JavaScript Fix (`modal-fix.js`)
- Prevents Bootstrap from creating backdrops
- Removes any existing backdrops automatically
- Overrides Bootstrap modal configuration
