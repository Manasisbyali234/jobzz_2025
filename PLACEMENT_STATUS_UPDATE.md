# Placement File Status Update Implementation

## Summary
Updated the placement file approval system to properly change file status from "pending" to "processed" when admin approves files.

## Changes Made

### Backend Changes

1. **adminController.js** - Updated `approveIndividualFile` function:
   - Changed file status from "approved" to "processed" after successful processing
   - Updated notification message to indicate candidates can login
   - Added login instructions in response

2. **adminController.js** - Updated `rejectIndividualFile` function:
   - Use custom file name in rejection notification

3. **Placement.js** model:
   - Confirmed status enum includes "processed" status

### Frontend Changes

1. **placement-dashboard.jsx** - Updated status display:
   - Added "processed" status handling with green success badge
   - Changed "approved" status to blue info badge
   - Updated timeline dots to show different colors for each status

2. **placement-details.jsx** - Updated admin view:
   - Added "processed" status handling
   - Updated badge colors and icons
   - Improved status messaging

## Status Flow

1. **pending** → File uploaded, waiting for admin approval (yellow warning badge)
2. **approved** → Admin approved but not yet processed (blue info badge) 
3. **processed** → Admin approved and candidates created, ready for login (green success badge)
4. **rejected** → Admin rejected the file (red danger badge)

## Key Features

- When admin clicks "Approve" on a file, it automatically processes the data and creates candidate accounts
- File status changes to "processed" indicating candidates can now login
- Candidates can login at `http://localhost:3000/placement/dashboard` using email/password from Excel
- Real-time status updates in both placement and admin dashboards
- Clear visual indicators for each status with appropriate colors and icons

## API Endpoint
- `POST /api/admin/placements/:id/files/:fileId/approve` - Approves and processes file, changes status to "processed"

## Testing
1. Upload Excel file as placement officer
2. Login as admin and navigate to placement details
3. Click "Approve" on pending file
4. Verify status changes to "processed" 
5. Verify candidates can login with Excel credentials
