# Mobile Menu Dark Screen Fix

## Issue Description
When clicking the main menu button on the candidate dashboard (http://localhost:3000/candidate/dashboard), a dark screen was appearing instead of the expected sidebar menu.

## Root Cause
The issue was caused by:
1. Improper overlay z-index management
2. Conflicting CSS transitions
3. Bootstrap modal backdrop interference
4. Incorrect sidebar state management on mobile devices

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Updated Candidate Layout (`candidate-layout.jsx`)
- Fixed mobile menu toggle logic with proper state management
- Added body class management to prevent scroll issues
- Improved overlay click handling
- Added debug logging for troubleshooting
- Enhanced mobile menu button with icon state changes

### 2. Created CSS Fixes
- **`candidate-layout-fix.css`**: Core layout fixes for sidebar positioning and overlay behavior
- **`mobile-menu-fix.css`**: Additional fixes for mobile-specific issues and Bootstrap conflicts

### 3. Key Improvements
- Reduced overlay opacity from 0.5 to 0.3 for less intrusive appearance
- Added proper transitions for smooth animations
- Fixed z-index stacking to prevent conflicts
- Prevented horizontal scrolling on mobile
- Added iOS Safari specific fixes
- Ensured proper modal and overlay interaction

## Files Modified
1. `src/layouts/candidate-layout.jsx`
2. `src/app/pannels/candidate/common/can-sidebar.jsx`

4. `src/mobile-menu-fix.css` (new)

## Testing
1. Navigate to http://localhost:3000/candidate/dashboard

4. Click outside the sidebar or the X button to close
5. Test on different screen sizes and devices

## Notes
