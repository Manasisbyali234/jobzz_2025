EmailJS Template Configuration Fix:

PROBLEM: "The recipients address is empty" - EmailJS can't find recipient email

SOLUTION: Update your EmailJS template settings:

1. Go to EmailJS Dashboard > Templates > template_7vg4zm5
2. In "Settings" tab, set:
   - To Email: {{to_email}}
   - To Name: {{to_name}}
   
3. In "Content" tab, use these variables:
   - {{to_email}} - recipient email
   - {{to_name}} - recipient name  
   - {{otp_code}} - the OTP code

4. Make sure "To Email" field in template settings points to {{to_email}}

The template must have the recipient email configured in the EmailJS dashboard settings, not just in the content.
