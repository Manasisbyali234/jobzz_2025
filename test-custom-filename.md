# Custom File Name Feature Test

## Feature Overview
Added the ability for placement officers to set custom display names for uploaded files.

## Changes Made

### Frontend (placement-dashboard.jsx)
1. Added state variables for custom file name modal
2. Added modal dialog for setting custom file names
3. Updated file upload process to show name input modal
4. Updated file history display to show custom names with original filename

### Backend (placementController.js)
1. Updated uploadStudentData to accept customFileName parameter
2. Added customName field to fileHistory entries
3. Updated notification messages to use display names
4. Updated all file-related responses to include customName

### Database (Placement.js)
1. Added customName field to fileHistory schema

## How It Works
1. User selects a file for upload
2. Modal appears asking for optional custom name
3. File uploads with both original filename and custom name
4. Admin sees custom name (with original filename shown below)
5. All notifications and messages use the display name

## Testing Steps
1. Go to http://localhost:3000/placement/dashboard
2. Upload a file
3. Enter a custom name like "CSE Batch 2024" 
4. Verify file appears with custom name in history
5. Check admin panel shows both names
6. Verify notifications use custom name

## Benefits
- Better organization of uploaded files
- Clearer identification for admins
- Maintains original filename for technical purposes
- Optional feature - works without custom names too
