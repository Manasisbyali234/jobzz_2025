# Course Field Fix for Placement Dashboard

## Issue
The Course field was showing empty in the placement dashboard at `http://localhost:3000/placement/dashboard`.

## Solution Applied

### 1. Frontend Changes (placement-dashboard.jsx)
- Updated data cleaning logic to properly map Course field from Excel data
- Added fallback value "Not Specified" for empty Course fields
- Added visual indicator (warning icon) for missing Course data
- Added sample data download link alongside template

### 2. Backend Changes (placementController.js)
- Updated `viewFileData` function to format Course field properly
- Updated `getFileData` and `getPlacementData` functions with fallback values
- Ensured consistent Course field mapping across all functions

### 3. Sample Data
- Created `sample-student-data.csv` with proper Course field examples
- Updated upload tips to mention Course field requirement

## How to Use

1. **For New Uploads:**
   - Download the "Sample Data" file from the placement dashboard
   - Use it as reference for proper Course field format
   - Ensure Course column contains degree names like:
     - "Computer Science Engineering"
     - "Information Technology"
     - "Mechanical Engineering"
     - etc.

2. **For Existing Data:**
   - If Course shows "Not Specified" with warning icon, the Excel file needs to be updated
   - Add proper course names to the Course column in your Excel file
   - Re-upload the file for admin approval

## Expected Course Field Values
- Computer Science Engineering
- Information Technology
- Electronics & Communication Engineering
- Mechanical Engineering
- Civil Engineering
- Electrical Engineering
- Chemical Engineering
- Biotechnology Engineering
- Aerospace Engineering
- Environmental Engineering

## Files Modified
- `frontend/src/app/pannels/placement/placement-dashboard.jsx`
- `backend/controllers/placementController.js`
- `frontend/public/assets/sample-student-data.csv` (new file)
